# worm_dodge
It is similar to the snake game, where the size of the worm increases after colliding with any obstacles (ball).
Here in the game if the worm collides with the ball, then the worm size increases and the balls will move randomly instead being at the constant position.
Worm can be contolled by using Keyboard arrow keys.
The game ends when the worm touches the boundary.
